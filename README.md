<img src="https://styviostorage.blob.core.windows.net/styviofilecontainer/logoBanner.png" alt="Chello API"> 
The Chello API is a suite of P2P chat, voice, and video web socket APIs to call within your application.  Users connect to eachother's network directly, skipping the need to pay for expensive middle-man servers.

## Get Your API Key :key:

Access the API using your API key: <a href="https://www.chello.chat/">Chello.chat</a>

## Rooms

All messages must go through a room.  Before sending any other type of request, you must first use your API key to create at least one room.  Note: this can be accomplished through the <a href="https://www.chello.chat/login/">dashboard</a> as well if you will only need a few rooms.

## Messages

Messages are sent and received using a websocket API, and managed through POST APIs.  Connect to the messaging API to stream a room's messages in real time.
